Hello Cedarians, I'm a developer with <CountYears from={2009} />+ years of experience building for the web. I care a lot about building a great product that users love. My strongest skills are with React and TypeScript, but I also have a strong background in design and UX. I've been leading frontend teams for many years, offering guidance and mentorship to junior developers. I'm also always looking for new patterns, technologies, and people to learn from and improve my work. On every team I work on, I strive to be a positive influence, deliver an excellent user experience, and help the team build a maintainable architecture. With my experience and skills, I'm confident I can help you build a great product. ðŸš€

  I'm really interested by the work Cedar is doing to improve the healthcare
  experience for patients and providers. I believe that technology can help us
  solve many of the problems in healthcare, and I'm excited to see a company
  like Cedar leading the way. I would love to learn more about how the Cedar
  team builds products that make a real difference in people's lives.
